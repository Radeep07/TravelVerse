## TravelVerse

As a web development team, we would likely be asked to create a web application from scratch with responsive design. Being a developer we need to work in a team collaboratively, managing effectively the version control of the application that is going to be deployed. That is why we formed a team and worked for this project called 'TravelVerse' which gives up-to-date travel information about the user seached location including local attractions, weather conditions and news feeds. This appliation uses a Node and Express server and is backed by a MySQL database. It is deployed using Heroku (with data)

### User Story

As a users, we do understand the importance of time that we put in when we plan for trips. Being user, the facilitation of a web application shuld be:

* As a user, I want an application with an intuitive user interface, so that I can easily navigate the app and plan my trip.
* As a user, I want search recommendations while typing name of the location, so that I can select from a list of all matched locations.
* As a user, I want to see locations with local attracions, their distance and star rating so that I set my priorities of my trip
* As a user, I want to check weather conditions and act accordingly.
* As a user, I would like to know the flash news of the location I am planning for.
* As a user, I wish to store my favourite places for future use.
